# House of 1000 mysteries

## Objective:
### - Create a text based adventure game with multiple scenarios using HTML, CSS and JS.

## To play the game:
### Click [here](house-of-1000-mysteries.surge.sh) to play the game

# Motivation:
### I just really wanted to make a silly adventure game in the vein of one of those old school text adventure games. I thought it would be cool to write my own scenario and options for them and it was also a challenge to myself. Initially I wanted to make a quiz game but then I had the amazing idea to make a "funny" adventure game. I'm a huge fan of skeletons so I had to use one in my story and everyone loves a good subversion of expectations.
